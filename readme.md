Weather App
---
An application I created in August 2017 that uses the OpenWeatherMap Api to generate the Local Weather.
The interface comes with a switch where you can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Possibly due to the 
time I've created this, the image links to help generate the weather visual expired.
